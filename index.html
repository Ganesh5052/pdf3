     <h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 27px;">Introduction: A Systematic<br> Procedure for Structuring the<br> Decision-Making Process</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>The basic types of decision models presented in the previous chapter (rational, descriptive, political, and ambiguous models) relies on quantitative values (money, time, or probabilities) that are most suitable for structured and semi-structured decision problems. These basic models can be used as starting
models to guide the structuring process of strategic decision problems. First,
a systematic procedure for structuring the strategic decision making process is
presented, using decision matrix and decision trees. The need for the sensitivity
analysis is introduced, and will be illustrated with more detail in the next chapter.
Some problems that must be considered in this structuring process are
illustrated in form of hidden traps and paradoxes.
The first step in the decision-making process is to formulate the problem. It is
possible that an inadequate formulation of the problem leads to a result that</p>
<p>reduces efficiency and efficacy, since an incorrect formulation can define a
wrong problem.
The person responsible for structuring the decision making model in a business
is in charge of <i style="font-size: 20px;">“asking the right questions, discovering the relevant
elements; identifying the significant parameters; determining the signifi-cant relationships among the selected elements and parameters; speculat-ing about the “right size” and “correct formulation” of the problem; and
evaluating the temporal characteristics (life cycles, duration, stability
and discontinuity)” (Luftman et al., 1993)</i></p>
     <p>Structuring a decision-making process depends on:</p>
     <p>a. the <i>purpose</i> of the decision;<br> b. <i>time</i> and <i>cost</i> limitations; and<br>
c. the <i>complexity</i> of the problem.
<p>The solution to any decision making problem can be visualized in five stages</p>
<p>1. perception: visualizing the need and opportunity for the decision;<br>
2. formulation of the action alternatives: evaluate the alternatives in terms of
their contributions;<br>
3. choosing one or more alternatives to be executed;<br>
4. implementation; and 50 feedback.</p>
<p>These stages are based on procedures known in Management Science as
PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, and Action). A more specific systematic procedure
for structuring a decision-making process is (Monks, 1985; Simon, 1997;
Clemen & Reilly, 2001):</p>
<p>1. <i>Define</i> the problem and the relevant variables <i>(parameters)</i>;<br>
2. Establish the <i>criteria, factors, goals,</i>or <i>objectives</i> of the decision (*);<br>
    3. Relate the parameters to the objectives, i.e., <i>>model</i>the problem;<br>
4. Generate the decision alternatives and the possible <i>alternative sce-narios,</i> for different values and parameters;<br>
5. Evaluate the alternatives and choose that which best satisfies the objec-tives;<br>
6. Implement the decision chosen and monitor the results through:</p>
<p><dd style="font-size: 20px;">(a) Sensitivity analysis of the results to be able to answer “what if?”-
type questions.</dd>
<dd style="font-size: 20px;">(b) Learning, using feedback from the results to be able to change or
improve the method.</dd>
<dd style="font-size: 20px;">(*) In decision analysis, criteria, factors, goals, and objectives are
terms used without a clear distinction. Inmathematical program-ming, a goal or an objective is expressed by a mathematical function to be optimized</dd></p><br>
<h3 style="text-align: center; font-size: 27px;">Building the Model</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>A model describes, represents, and imitates the procedures that happen in the
real world, establishing the relationship of the variables with the objectives in
the best way possible, observing the time and cost limitations. The models can
be of various types (Gordon, 1978; Monks, 1985):</p>
<p>a. <b>Verbal</b> – when described and represented by phrases and sentences
(examples: questionnaires, expert systems, etc.);<br>
b. <b>Physical</b> – when represented by some kind of material or hardware,
changing their dimensions, size, or format (examples: miniature models,
prototypes);<br>
c. <b>Schematic</b> – when represented by graphics, tables, diagrams, or decision
tree;<br>
d. <b>Mathematical</b> – when represented by mathematical equations, numeri-cal values, or symbolic logic values [examples: Linear programming,
(Hillier & Lieberman, 1980); Neural Networks, (Takefuji, 1996), etc.]</p>

<p>A mathematical model can be seen as a <i>black box</i> that receives the <i>inputs</i>
(parameters, exogenous variables, and decisions), and processes this informa-tion to produce <i>outputs(endogenous variables</i> or decision r</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 27px;">Decision Problem in Matrix Form</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>A mathematical decision model can be organized in a matrix form where:</p>
<p>a.  <b>The columns of the matrix represent the alternatives of decision.</b>
Each column of the matrix represents one of the possible alternatives. Ai
is presented to the decider or the person who makes the decision. All the
possible alternatives for the decision should be formulated. We then can
say that the set of possible alternatives is exhaustive and covers all the
fields of definition of the problem. The alternatives should also be mutually
exclusive, i.e., one decision alternative excludes the others. The unknown
alternatives should be grouped into just one set to form the alternative,
“other alternatives”.<br>
b.  <b>Possible states assumed by the problem are set out along the line
of the matrix.</b> All the possible statesof the problem should be placed
along the lines of the matrix, i.e., the alternative states that the problem can
assume. The states represent the possible results of the problem (market,
economy, population, etc.), or the results of actions taken by an adversary
when there is a situation of conflict. The possible states Sj
 should form an
exhaustive and mutually exclusive set. Unknown states should appear
grouped along one of the lines of the matrix marked as “others.” A
probability value estimating the possibility of occurrence P (Sj
) is attrib-uted to each S</p>
<p>Each element gji of the decision matrix represents the gain (profit, loss, or cost)
of alternative Aj
 (column j of the matrix) when state Si
 occurs. The values of
these results should be predefined for all the possible alternatives and states. In
general, these values are approximated or estimated values based on past
experience and problems of the same type.<br>
The occurrence of each state is not always certain as to what happens with no risk-rational-decision problems. In the case of uncertainty or risk, each Sj state
is associated with a probability P(Sj). Since the possible states should form an
exhaustive set and should be mutually exclusive, the sum of probability of all the
states is equal to one. The value of each probability also should be estimated
by an expert or by the group of person of the decision-making process.
A decision matrix has the following format</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 27px;">Decision Tree</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>A decision matrix represents a decision process to be resolved in a single stage.
A decision tree is used to represent a sequential decision making process
through more than one stage of the decision (Figure 9.1).<br>
A decision tree is a schematic representation useful for representing the process
of decision making with multiple variables, multiple objectives, and multiple
decision stages, while the decision matrix represents just one of the stages in the
decision-making process.<br>
The decision tree structures any complex decision problem in a clear way since
it can identify the alternatives, the states and the possible scenarios. However,
its visualization becomes difficult when the size and complexity of the problem
increase, even using the resource of a computer software. This restriction is true
for all other types of representations of decision problems</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 27px;">Basic Structures of Decisions Problems</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>We are now ready to present the basic structures of decision problems found
in the literature of decision analysis. In the next chapters, these structures will
be expanded in the sense to include the complex factors and nonstructured
aspects that are common in strategic-decision problems (Clemen & Reilly,
2001; Keeney & Raiffa, 1976; Naylor et al., 1971).<br>
Decision problems to select the best alternative under no-risk, uncertainty, or
risk situations will be discussed. For all cases, decision problems with single or
multiple criteria or goals, using utility values, will be presented. Also, a decision
model updated using feedback from additional information will be presented</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 27px;">Decision Problem with No Risk and One Criterion or
Goal</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>This decision problem has:<br><br>
a. several decision alternatives (for instance, property A1, A2 and A3), and<br>
b. one criterion or goal: cash payment, payment in 4 or 12 installments.<br><br>
Since this is a problem with no risks or uncertainties, all the relevant information
(gains or losses referring to each decision alternative) is known and the decision
maker chooses the alternative related to the best possible result.</p>
<p><i>Example 9.1: Select a Property According to Highest Net Income</i></p>
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -20px;">
<p>Company XYZ analyzes 3 alternatives for buying a building for a branch office,
based on the Net Income Criterion which depends on the different forms of
payment used. For each property, A1, A2. or A3, there are three payment
alternatives (cash, 4 or 12 installments), and the Net Incomes, in thousand of
dollars, are:</p>
<!-----------------------------------Table2--------------------------------------->
<b>Decision Matrix</b>
<table>
 <tr>
    <td>Criteria/Properties</td>
    <td>A1</td>
    <td>A2</td>
    <td>A3</td>
 </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Cash</td>
    <td>$470</td>
    <td>$500</td>
    <td>$420</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>4 installments</td>
    <td>460</td>
    <td>470</td>
    <td>415</td>
 </tr>
<tr>
    <td>12 installments</td>
    <td>460</td>
    <td>450</td>
    <td>450</td>
 </tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>This decision involves no risk or uncertainty, since the three alternatives are
known and mutually exclusive and the choice of payment depends entirely on
the decision maker’s wish. Alternative A3 has all decision values lower or equal
to those of A2 and, thus, it is dominated by A2 and can be discarded from the
decision process. So, there are only two alternatives left, A1 and A2.<br>
The decision can be made using the Min/Max or Max/Min principles (Hillier &
Lieberman, 1980; Cook & Russel, 1993). The Min/Max principle is known as
the <i>optimistic</i> decision; since it minimizes the highest income, while the Max/ Min principle is know as the <i>pessimistic</i> decision, since it maximizes the lowest income.</p>
<p>a. <b>Decision using the Max/Min principle.</b> Using the Max/Min principle,
one should <i>“choose the strategy offering the highest value among the
lowest values of each strategy”, that is,</i>Max/Min = Maximum (Minimum value of A1 and A2) = Max (460, 450) =460. This value refers to
alternative A1.<br>
b. <b>Decision using the Min/Max principle.</b> According to this criteria, one
should <i>“choose the strategy offering the lowest value among the
highest values of each strategy”, that is,</i> Min/Max = Min (470, 500) =
470. This value also refers to alternative A1. Thus, we have Min/Max =
Max/Min, in this example</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 27px;">Decision with No Risk and More Than One Criterion or
Goal</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>When a decision problem has several criteria or goals expressed in different
units, (for instance, expected income, distance, etc.) it is necessary to transform
each one of these values into the same unit of measurement. In a given
decision, the value of income cannot be mixed with other objective, such as
competitive edge, (expressed by the property’s location), comfort (the number
of rooms, visibility, etc.), or area (in square meters).<br>
All these values should be transformed into the same unit called satisfaction
level or utility, whose values vary from 0 (to the worst level of satisfaction) to
1 (to the best level of satisfaction) (Luce & Raiffa, 1957; Goodwin & Wright,
1996).<br>
Another difficulty refers to the conflicting nature of these goals, as in the case
of minimization of cost and maximization of employee labor conditions,
because the best solution to <i>minimize cost usually may not maximize labor
conditions.</i> The three goals (net income, competitive edge and available area)
of Example 9.2 are to be maximized, but the best solutions for each goal
correspond to different alternatives.
There is no solution fully satisfying all goals considered. A consensual solution
based on the Pareto’s principle is usually adopted</p>
<p>The <dd style="font-size: 20px;">x<i>Pareto’s Principle (Goicoechea et al., 1982; Hillier &
Lieberman, 1980)</i></dd><br><br>
<dd style="font-size: 20px;"><i>If a solution x* of a problem with k goals fk
 (x) is such that it is not
possible to find any solution x with fk

Kinds of Benefits (adapted from Goodwin & Wright, 1996)</i></p>

<p>Company XYZ studies three alternatives for buying a property for a new

<p>The worst and the best values of each goal should correspond to values 0 and
1 of the utility function, respectively. Utilities for the intermediate values are
determined using different utility curves and will be explained in the next
chapter.</p>

<p>In general, the three criteria should not be given equal weights, and the company
should choose the criterion with the greatest importance. If, for the company,
Net Income is the most important criterion or objective, then it gets a relative
weight equal to 1.<br>

<p><i>Sensitivity Analysis</i></p>
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -20px;">
<p>The value of weights may alter the decision result. If we attribute a zero weight
to Net Income and the same relative weights of 0.50 and 0.80 are kept for the
two other criteria, the property chosen will be the property A3.<br>
In order to analyze the variation of the three weights it is possible to use a two-dimensional chart, placing the variation of the sum of two of the three weights
(for instance, p = W2 + W3) on the horizontal axis, and the variation of the utility<br>
average on the vertical axis. The third weight W1 corresponds to the value 1
– p. For instance, for p  the best decision is to buy property A2, while
for p between 0.5 and 0.9, the best decision is property A1. For p > 0.90 and
weight (Income) W1  the best decision is property A3.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 27px;">Subjective Perception of Risk</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>(Excerpted from: Subjective Perception of Risk, Mark Fenton-O’Creevy
and Emma Soane, Financial Times, Mastering Risk, Part I, May 2, 2000, pp.
14-15).<br>
Risk perception is a complex and subjective process. In finances, risk is usually
considered as a combination of the values of expected loss or gain and the
variability of this expected result. Human perception of risk acts in a different
way. There are two important risk components affecting our perception: the
fear factor — referring to fear of potential result — and the control factor —
referring to the level of control over events. For instance, risk perception is very
high in a nuclear accident due to the fear factor or, it is higher for a car passenger
than the driver, due to control perception. In the financial market, both factors
are important –fear and anticipation of losses often control our actions. One
financial broker stated that “we often make decisions based more on the fear
of losing, than the hope of winning.”<br>
The largest risk perception component is in how we perceive gain and loss.
Persons in a winning position of a game increasingly have an aversion to risk,
since they want to keep their gains, while individuals in a losing position are
more willing to take risks, because they have less to lose.<br>
However, what we perceive as gain or loss depends on the personal standpoint,
which changes according to the situation and over time.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 27px;">Decision Problem Under Uncertainty or Risk</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>Economic and financial theories often make sure that a person makes optimum
use of available intuition as a basis for a rational decision, but research and
verification of daily behavior shows that human behavior is significantly different
from this statement.<br>
In many decision problems, the states of nature occur with a certain level of
uncertainty known as risk. It is then no longer possible to apply the Min/Max
or Max/Min principle since the risk occurrence with different probabilities does
not allow the choice of a greater or smaller gain value. One needs to obtain the
average or expected values.<br>

<p>Decision based on the highest average or expected monetary value.
As we already know by the example of descriptive model of decision shown
in Chapter VIII, the Expected Monetary Values (EMV) of the alternatives are:</p><br>
<p><dd style="font-size: 23px;">EMV1
 = 0.40 x 300 + 0.40 x 300 + 0.20 x 300 = $300<br>
EMV2
 = 0.40 x 400 + 0.40 x 300 + 0.20 x 200 = $320<br>
EMV3
 = 0.40 x (-100) + 0.40 x 200 + 0.20 x 700 = $180</dd></p><br>
<p>The best decision is strategy A2, followed by A1, and finally A3</p><br>

<p><i>Sensitivity Analysis</i></p>
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -20px;">
<p>It is helpful to check the variation of expected values for different probability
values p1, p2, and p3, thus getting a chart that allows the analysis of strategic
limits of investments risks.<br>
In order to assess value variations for p1, p2, and p3, the chart suggested by
Clemen and Reilly (2001) is adopted and shown in Figure 9.2. Since there are
three variables p1, p2, and p3, the values for p1 are placed on the horizontal
axis and p2 on the vertical axis. Values of p3 are implicitly expressed by the
property p1 + p2 +p3 =1. For instance, if p1 = 0 and p2 = 0, then p3 = 1; if
p1 = 0.2 and p2 = 0.2, then p3 =0.6, and so on.<br>
In case of more than three risk possibilities, the sensitivity assessment using a
chart becomes impossible. In Sensitivity Analysis chart of Figure 9.2, each
point (p1, p2) contains the name of the best Aj alternative for a given risk value
(p1, p2, p3). For instance, in the numerical example seen, we have p1 = 0.4,
p2 = 0.4 and p3 = 0.2 with the expected EMV1
 values = 300, EMV2
 = 320
and EMV3
 = 180. Thus, point (0.4, 0.4) will have A2 as the best alternative.<br>
Once the best expected value is obtained for all different probability values,
expressed by the points (p1, p2) in the chart, the strategic regions where each
Aj investment alternative is the best solution are easily known.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 27px;">The Role of Utility Function</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>A “decision based only on <i>expected monetary values”</i>may not be perfect
since it does not analyze every earning possibility, such as highest profit or
worst loss. Besides, expected value based on numeric values such as money,
dimension, or age does not allow the inclusion of nonquantitative criteria such
as “client satisfaction”, “product quality”, etc. The decision based on the “level
of <i>satisfaction or utility function,”</i> associated to each quantitative or non
quantitative (or qualitative) value, best expresses the decision alternatives.<br>
In the Example 9.3, a decision should consider other factors involving the
decision maker’s interests. Using the expected monetary values EMV, a player
or decision maker should never get the highest earning of $700 given in
alternative A3, even at the risk of losing (-$100). Utility function transforms
quantitative and qualitative values in corresponding utility values, allowing
better analysis of complex decision problems</p>
<p><i>Risk Neutral Decision-Making</i></p>
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -20px;">
<p>If the decision maker is risk neutral, he or she would use the risk neutral curve
of Figure 9.3 and would probably not choose alternative A3, where $700 is the
highest earning value and $100 represents a loss.<br>
A risk neutral decision maker is usually a midsized or large organization with
long experience in its activity. Thus, data placed on the decision matrix were
analyzed by a consultant team, and there would be no reason to doubt the linear
behavior of these values</p>
<p><i>Risk Averter Decision-Making</i></p>
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -20px;">
<p>Using the risk aversion curve of Figure 9.3 for the Example 9.3, one may have,
for instance:</p>

<img src="WhatsApp%20Image%202024-02-07%20at%208.43.23%20PM.jpeg"><br>
<p>The average values using these utility values are:</p><br>
<p><dd style="font-size: 23px;">EMV1
 = 0.4 x 0.75 + 0.4 x 0.75 + 0.2 x 0.75 = 0.75;<br>
EMV2
 = 0.4 x 0.85 + 0.4 x 0.75 + 0.2 x 0.62 = 0,764; and<br>
EMV3
 = 0.4 x 0 + 0.4 x 0.62 + 0.2 x 1 = 0.448.
</dd></p><br>
<p>Risk averter decision makers wishing to maximize their personal satisfaction
with the utility function would choose alternative A2. A risk averter person or
organization is one with small amount of resources or with little experience in
this kind of decision. A risk averter cannot count on counseling or assistance
from other people or organizations to explain the pros and cons of the
alternatives presented. However, there are different risk aversion levels,
depending on whether there is greater or lesser knowledge of the problem. For
instance, when buying real state, both the homemaker who wishes to buy a
house and the real estate broker may be risk averters. The homemaker’s risk
aversion level is usually higher than the broker’s.</p>
<p><i>Risk Taker Decision-Making</i></p>
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -20px;">
<p>By using the curve expressing “risk taker or <i>risk preference”</i> in Figure 9.2,
the decision maker may get, for instance, the following expected earnings:
EMV1
 = 0.18, EMV2
 = 0.217 and EMV3
 = 0.25 and thus could choose
alternative A3, where there is highest risk, but with earning possibilities of
$700. A person or organization prefers to take risks when believes that the
reward is worth the risk or when the time frame limit enforces a risky alternative</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 27px;">Decision Model with Learning, Using Additional
Information</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>Learning process in descriptive models of decision can be made using the
adaptive or feedback model of statistics. The best known learning process is
made using Bayes’ Theorem, in which prior values of probabilities can be
updated by additional information collected through a new sampling process
(Shamblin & Stevens, 1980; Hillier & Liebermann, 1980; Takahashi, 1997).
This process can be repeated many times, renewing the values of probabilities
at each step of decision. The following Example 9.4 illustrates this process.</p>
<p><i>Example 9.4. Renewing Probabilities in an Opinion Survey</i></p>
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -20px;">
<p>Senator Bill Hernandez (BH) is a candidate for the next presidential election.
His supporting committee hired an opinion research company to conduct, in
each month prior to the election day, a nationwide opinion survey about the
preference of the electoral population, whether preferring Senator BH or the
other adversary. The results of the last research, expressed in probability terms
were: P (S1)= P(BH wins)= 0.3, P (S2)= P (there is a tie)= 0.3, and P (S3)=
P (Adversary wins)= 0.4.<br>
After each round of the research, one of the following decisions must be taken
by the supporting committee:</p><br>
<p>A1 = {Raise more funds for the campaign} or<br>
A2 = {Invite the other candidate for a debate in nationwide TV network} or<br>
A3 = {Continue the campaign as previously planned}.</p><br>
<p>The payoff values in terms of numbers of voters estimated to be won or lost for
each probability value and decision alternative, are:</p>
<!-- --------------------------Table7------------------------------------->
<br>
<p>Average values of win or loss of number of voters for each decision alternative are:</p>
<p><dd style="font-size: 23px;">EA1 = 0.3 100,000 + 0.3 150,000 + 0.4 50,000 = 95,000;<br>
EA2 = 0.3 100,000 + 0.3 200,000 + 0.4 150,000 = 150,000; and<br>
EA3 = 0.3 50,000 + 0.3 (-50,000) + 0.4 (-200,000) =(-80,000).
</dd></p><br>
<p>Thus, the best decision alternative is A2.<br>
Fifteen days after the nationwide survey, a small scale opinion survey including
only the major capital cities, is conducted in the sense of updating the results of
the previous survey. The result of this small scale survey, called additional
information F, predicted that F = {BH wins in the major capital cities}.<br>
Based on this addition information F, the opinion research company will predict
whether or not candidate BH wins. The difficulty is that the result of this small
scale survey, made only in major capital cities, does not always coincide with
the final result of the election.<br>
In the past, the supporting committee observed that 60% of the time, this
additional research predicted that “BH wins in major capitol cities”, then the
election was actually won by BH. This fact can be expressed as the conditional
probability P (F / S1)= 0,6.<br>
On the other hand, 40% of time the additional research predicted that “BH wins
in major capitol cities”, the election ended in a tie between the two candidates,
while only 20% of time, the election was actually won by the other candidate.
Then, for the additional information F we have the other two conditional
probabilities: P (F / S2) = 0.4 and P (F / S3)= 0.2. Using probability formula
we have:</p>
<p><dd style="font-size: 23px;">P (F) = P {BH wins in major capitol cities}=<br>
0.3 0.6 + 0.3 0.4 + 0.4 0.2 = 0.38.</dd></p>
<p>New probabilities values (known as posterior probabilities) updated by this
additional information F, according to Bayes’ Theorem are:</p><br>
<p><dd style="font-size: 23px;">Prob(S1 / F)= (0.3 0.6)/ 0.38 = 0.474,<br>
Prob(S2 / F)= (0.3 0.4)/ 0.38 = 0.316, and<br>
Prob(S3 / F)= (0.4 0.2)/ 0.38 = 0.210.</dd></p>
<p>The new payoff table using these probabilities is:</p>

<br>
<p>After this additional information F, average values of win or loss of voters for
each decision are:</p>
<p><dd style="font-size: 23px;">EA1 = 0.474 100,000 + 0.316 150,000 + 0.210 50,000 = 105,200,<br>
EA2 = 0.474 100,000 + 0.316 200,000 + 0.210 150,000 = 165,800, and<br>
EA3 = 0.474 50,000 + 0.316 (-50,000) + 0.210 (-200,000) = -34,100.</dd></p>
<p>Best decision is again A2, and the additional information F = {BH wins in major
capital cities} reinforces this strategy.<br>
Each month, after the results of the nationwide opinion survey, this updating
process can be repeated.</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 27px;">Additional Problems That Must Be
Considered in Structuring a Strategic-Decision-Model</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>It is important to remind us that in a strategic-decision-making procedure many
other factors become more and more difficult and complex in a systematic way
to structure the decision process. The systematic structuring methodology
presented in the previous sections are valid for decision problems of tactical or
operational levels and must be considered as a starting procedure for strategic-decision problems.<br>
Many types of difficulties must be considered when a strategic-decision
problem is to be structured. These difficulties are reported by researchers in the
form of paradoxes or hidden traps that reflect the different aspects of human
behavior under uncertainty, risk or complexity to determine a consistent list of
decision alternatives.<br>
Most of the difficulties are related to the problem of how an individual or
group’s risk attitude can change depending on the way the decision problem is
posed. A person may have different attitudes (risk neutral, risk preference or
aversion to risk) to lose a certain amount of money during the initial and final
phase of a gamble or, when the total amount of money available to play the
game or invest in the stock market is small or large.<br>
A person’s or group’s attitude can change depending on many factors such as
time, financial situation, or responsibilities according to the problem to be
solved. This fact is known asframing problem because different persons can
see different frames (of values or structures), simplifying the reality.<br>
The effects of hidden traps mentioned in a Case Study, as well as Allais or
Ellsberg’s paradox can be minimized forming different decision alternatives
given by different groups of persons. These alternatives are discussed and a
final decision can be reached by negotiation or by the use of votes. St.<br>
Petersburg’s paradox is concerned with the possibility of unknown value of
probability expectation but the use of utility value can help to solve the problem.
</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 27px;">The Paradoxes</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>St. Petersburg’s paradox (Takahashi, 1997; Clemen & Reilly, 2001; Goodwin
& Wright, 1996)<br>
Let us consider the following two types of coin tossing game which must be held
until the first occurrence of “head.”</p>
<p><b>Game I:</b><br>
<dd style="font-size: 23px;">If the first head occurs in the first trial, the player receives $2; if it occurs
in the second trial, he or she receives $4, and son on, until the occurrence
of head in the k-th trial, when he or she receives $2k.</dd><br>
<b style="font-size: 23px;">Game II:</b><br>
<dd style="font-size: 23px;">Whichever trial occurs head for the first time, the player receives a fixed
    amount of money $W. Which one of the games must a player select?</dd></p>
<p>Game II gives always the Expected Value E2 = $ W.<br>
Expected Value of Game I is E1 = , according to probability theory. Thus, the
profit in Game I is, at least theoretically, greater than any value of profit in Game<br>
II. But in Game I, we assume that the profit is greater than any amount $W if
the coin is tossed an infinite number of times. What is the meaning of “infinite
number of times”? The answer is the number K of trials of a coin until the first
occurrence of a head has a geometric distribution with expected value E(K) =
1/p, or E(K) = 2, for the case of the coin, where p=1/2. Thus Game II will be
preferred when the expected monetary value $ W is greater than $2, which is
a value far from infinite.<br>
This paradox can be solved using the utility function, that shows that game II
must be preferred when the monetary value $W is more than $4, which satisfies
the decision based on the expected value of the geometric distribution.</p>
<p>b. Allais’s Paradox (Takahashi, 1997; Goodwin & Wright, 1996; Raiffa,
2002)</p><br>
<p>This paradox presents the following two games in which decision based on
utility values reaches contradictory relations.</p>
<img src="WhatsApp%20Image%202024-02-08%20at%2012.14.28%20PM.jpeg" style="width: 50%; height: 60%; text-align: center;">
<br>
<p><i>Questions</i></p>
<hr style="height:2px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -20px;">
<p>Which of the two options (A or B) would you choose in Game I?<br>
Which of the two options (C or D) would you choose in Game II?</p>
<p>Game 1:<br>
<dd style="font-size: 23px;">Usually, due to the fixed profit of Option A, persons consider that the
utility value of A is greater than the utility value of B, or:
U(A)>= U(B), or
U(200)>= 0.10 x U(1000)+ 0.89xU(200)+ 0.01x U(0) and then
0.11 x U(200)>= 0.10 x U(1000) + 0.01 x U(0).</dd></p>
<p>Game 2:<br>
<dd style="font-size: 23px;">The probability of profit $200 of option C is similar to the probability of
profit $1000 of option D. It seems reasonable that persons prefer a
greater profit ($1000 versus $200). Using utility we have:
U(C)(D)or
0.11 x U(200)+ 0.89 x U(0) 0.10 x U(1000)+ 0.90 x U(0)and then
0.11 x U(200)  0.10 x U(1000)+ 0.01 x U(0).</dd></p>
<p>Thus, this paradox presents two contradictory inequalities, which may be
explained by the fact that utility theory does not attempt to describe the way in
which people choose a utility value</p>
<p>c.   A final paradox (Ellsberg’s Paradox) solves Allais’s paradox considering
different attitudes of persons’ preference with respect to uncertainty and
risk: neutral to risk, aversion to risk, and preference to risk, relaxing the
fundamental law of probability theory, where the sum of the probabilities
of all the events must be equal to 1</p>
<h3 style="font-size: 27px; text-align: center;">Conclusions</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>In this chapter, steps to structure a decision model through a systematic way,
based on the PDCA (Plan, Do, Check, and Action) principle, were presented.<br>
The decision matrix and decision tree are tools used to organize a starting model
of a strategic-decision problem. A decision matrix is used to represent a onestage decision problem while a decision tree is used to represent a sequence of
decision-making stages.<br>
Examples of problems to select the best alternative under no risk, uncertainty,
or risk situation were presented. For all cases, decision problems with single
or multiple criteria or goals, using utility values, were presented. A decision
model updated using feedback from additional information was also presented.<br>
Difficulties to be considered in the structuring process of decision models are
illustrated in the form of paradoxes or hidden traps that reflect the different
aspects of human behavior under uncertainty, risk, or complexity, to determine
a consistent list of decision alternatives.<br>
In the following chapters, we will extend the structuring process described in
this chapter, to more general and different kinds of strategic-decision-making
problems.</p>

<h3 style="font-size: 27px;">Case – The Hidden Traps in Decision-Making</h3><hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;background-color:black; margin-top: -30px;">
<p>(Excerpted from “The Hidden Traps in Decision Making “, by J .S. Hammond,
R. L. Keeney and H. Raiffa, Harvard Business Review, September- October,
1998, pp. 47 to 54)</p><br>
<dd style="font-size: 23px;"><i>“In making decisions, your own mind may be your worst enemy.”</i></dd><br>
<p>What are the causes of a bad decision? Due to the complexity in structuring and
formulating a decision-making problem and the high level of subjective judgment, bad decisions occur frequently. The “hidden traps” which accompany the
decision-making process can cause errors in the formulation and structuring of
a decision problem, as well as in choosing the correct alternative.<br>
The main traps are:</p><br>
<p>1. <b>“the anchoring trap”</b> – one of the most common types of an anchor (a
weight that hangs from the ship in the same place) is a fixation on the
“historical past” or “worldwide trend” or on “tradition”<br><br>
2. <b>“the status-quo trap”</b> – the innovative alternatives tend to be similar to
those that have been abandoned, or are just the same idea presented in a
different way, i.e. there is an accommodation to remain in the same status;<br><br>
3. <b>“the sunk-cost trap”</b> – many decisions try to take losses (or gains) from
the past into account, even though they are irrecoverable;<br><br>
4. <b>“the confirming-evidence trap”</b> – many decisions are based on evidences assumed in a polemical manner, such as “investing in television
advertising is essential”, “we must invest in R&D”, etc.;<br><br>
5. <b>“the framing trap”</b> – the same problem can be represented by a decision
tree or table in a different way, depending on the point of view adopted;<br><br>
6. <b>“the estimating and forecasting trap”</b> – the effects of subjective or
superficial judgments should be minimized in the estimation of values or
demand forecasting;<br><br>
7. <b>“the overconfidence and prudence trap” </b>– excessive confidence or
caution is not recommended in obtaining information or making decisions</p>
<p>One way to minimize the occurrence of “bad decisions” is to use the process
of Sensibility Analysis, submitting a decision to controlled variations of the
values involved. This analysis can be done if there is an opportunity to ask
questions such as “WHAT IF?” at any given moment.</p>

<p>1. Project:<br>
Make up several groups with five people at most in each. Use the Sunday
classified ads from some national newspapers and construct the decision
model (the decision matrix and the decision tree) for the following
problems:<br><br>
(a) Select a residential property;<br>
(b) Select a piece of land to install a branch office of your company;<br>
(c) Choose a job;<br>
(d) Select a candidate for the position of manager;<br>
(e) Choose a new automobile;<br>
(f) Select a used car.<br><br>
Each problem should have at least five decision alternatives, i.e., choose
five residential properties, five pieces of land, five cars, etc. The parameters and objectives or criteria for the decision should be defined by each
group. Compare the decision matrixes constructed by different groups
and discuss the causes for existing differences.<br>
